Current version:
- Multiple testng.xml files
- Error message if class not found when running single-class test
- Remove super(string) if converting from a JUnit class




Next version:
[2005.03.06]
[TNGE-011]:[CRITICAL] better way to clean up the temp suite files
[TNGE-002]: support running tests from selected directories (see TNGE-003)
[TNGE-005]: Suite customizer
[TNGE-007] The Green Bar Window should indicate what it just
ran ("Suites: testng.xml" or "Groups:  current assert"): started, still to refine


DONE:

[TNGE-008] Need to add a few i18n strings (in the green bar window)
[TNGE-009] I think we should remove SPF from the green bar window (confusing 
and my guess is, not very used)
[TNGE-010] Groups launcher
[TNGE-006] Suite search is taking too long. Must be optimized!!!
[TNGE-001] The Group dialog should reflect what was found in the text field 
(if anything).  Right now, it always shows up with everything unchecked
[TNGE-003] Remove duplicates in the group dialog
[TNGE-004] [FIXED: 2005.03.23] I'm using checkboxes instead of radioboxes 
right now.  Couldn't get the radio to work because the events don't tell you if
you are being unchecked or checked.
